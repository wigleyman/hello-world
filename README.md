#Hello-World

My name is Martin. I am originally from the UK but live in Asia.\I have recently developed an obsession with all things programming.
Learning new stuff every day. It is one of the most challenging and rewarding things I have ever done. Loving it so far.

Just starting out learning a little about C but looking to get into AI or game dev.

Help or advice much appreciated.

Cheers!
